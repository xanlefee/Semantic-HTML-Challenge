#Creating Semantic HTML for a Marketing Website




[DEPLOY LINK](https://xanlefee.github.io/Semantic-HTML-Challenge/)


This project swaps non-semantic HTML for semantic HTML in order to make the website more accessible. 
All users can now navigate the contents and structure of the website with greater ease. 
This project highlights the importance of semantic HTML in optimising a website for different user needs.


Some issues along the way included changing the divs to semantic elements without compromising the layout of the page. 
Through trial and error, I managed to keep the imformation layout as intended and used comments to aid greater clarity in the index. 

## Installation

## Usage
